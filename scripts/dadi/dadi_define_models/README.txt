Defines the different 38 models of divergence used in our inferences with ∂a∂i.
There are six categories of models: "SI": Strict Isolation, "IM": Isolation with Migration, "AM": Ancient Migration, "PAM": Periodic Ancient Migration, "SC": Secondary Contact and "PSC": Periodic Secondary Contact. 
Each model comes in subcategories: "no suffix": Reference model; "ex": Exponential growth; "2N": Background selection with 2 categories of population size in the genome (we assume population size is reduced by a given factor in non-recombining regions); "2M2P": Selection against migrants with 2 categories of migration rate in the genome (we assume migration is zero in barrier regions); and the combinations between subcategories: "2N2M2P"; "2Nex"; "2M2Pex"; "2N2M2Pex".
All models assume an initial ancestral population which is split into two daughter populations.
